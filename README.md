# UViip-LFMImager
## University of Victoria ionospheric imaging project's LFM imager

This research effort was done thanks to a collaboration with [FTS](https://ftsinc.com/). The results and data are stored separately and to gain access to them, Peter Driessen should be contacted at UVic.

There is some documentation in the [docs](./docs) folder on how to get setup with the LimeSDR, and there is a useful repository ([ettus-utils](https://github.com/mistic-lab/ettus-utils)) which has some handy tools for working with USRPs.

This work culminated in a final report which can be found on Overleaf by contacting Peter Driessen or Nicholas Bruce at UVic.

The authors of this work were primarily [Nicholas Bruce](https://github.com/nsbruce) and [Peter Kremler](https://github.com/pkremler), both MASc students at the time.
